# N-bodies-problem
In this code I have solved with three specific methods the N bodies problem with some examples. In fact, I have used the Euler explicit, Runge Kutta 2 and 4 methods . For the examples, I took the data from NASA Database to illustrate the problem. As a result, you will able, with this code, to can plot the Solar system,  the trajectory of Voyager one and two and the Halley comet.
